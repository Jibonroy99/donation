        <div class="relief-part">
            <p class="first-para"> <b>Relief </b> for Flood Affected Victims in Bangladesh
                Heavy monsoon rain and water from upstream in India's northeast have inundated large parts of
                the
                Sylhet
                division in Bangladesh. Millions of people are marooned without electricity which already
                triggered
                a
                humanitarian crisis. The flash floods swept away homes and inundated farmlands, forcing families
                to
                seek
                shelter on higher ground and temporary flood shelters.
                According to the Flood Forecasting and Warning Centre (FFWC), around 94 percent of Sunamganj and 84
                percent of Sylhet are submerged and are almost cut off from the rest of the country. The FFWC
                forecasted that the flood situation in Sylhet and Sunamganj districts is likely to deteriorate
                further in the next few days with heavy rain forecast. Experts consider the current flood worse than
                the ones they had experienced in 1998 and 2004. An estimated 4.3 million people are impacted by this
                sudden calamity in seven northeastern districts of Sylhet, Sunamganj, Moulivazar, Habiganj,
                Netrakona, and Brahmanbaria.</p>

        <div class="help-part">
            <img src="flood-4.jpeg" alt="">
            <p class="second-para">To help out flood affected families, ECHO started distributing relief packages
                which
                includes basic
                supplies like rice, puffed rice, molasses, saline water, potatoes, lentils, candles and matchlights.
                For only 100 taka, you can provide a family with much-needed food and essential items during these
                difficult times. These families are in urgent need of your support, so please consider donating to
                our flood drive.</p>
